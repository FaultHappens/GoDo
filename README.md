# GoDo: Adventure Today
Click a button, get a new fun challenge for the day

Name: Your own adventure / Your Adventure / Adventure Today / TodVenture / GoDo : Adventure Today 
Click a button, get a new fun challenge for the day (visit a museum, try a food, take a different route).
The idea of an app is to make people go out more, find friends, companions, love. 

features:
	- We can add some subtasks for that, for example if the place is a bar, try their cocktail etc.
	- This thing will have social network element, like BeReal
	- The deadline will be 1 day, like till the end of the day
	- For now app will be focused on Georgia, Tbilisi
	- We can use chatgpt to inspect the place generated and check the menu, check what kind of services they offer, when do they work untill etc
	- Will have a co-op mode, with your friends or strangers, for example team of 4 will get the same location, where they will need to meet, chat and they can help each others to complete subtasks
	- No personal details on account, just comments from others that they met (might be a good idea)
	- Max 1 adventure a day, like all those xxdle games.
	- User would be able to choose the type of adventure like hike somewhere, eat somewhere, drink somewhere etc
	- Proofs. Once they complete the adventure they would need to upload a proof, like a picture, geolocation etc. For co-op a proof might be for example some code phrase that only other person knows.
	- Users will have a score of completed and failed adventures
	- There also could be adventures not just for a day, but week or month. For example some things, that u need to prepare for like hike, camping, concert (buy tickets) etc	

monetisation: 
	- Bars, restaurants etc could pay us to be featured 
	- Advertisement 


UX: 
	- On the main page there will be a map, on top of the map there will be a generate adventure dialog. Dialog will have a Solo/Duo(for love)/Company selector for an adventure. There also should be a possibility to choose the type of adventure, like hike somewhere, eat somewhere, drink somewhere etc
	- If the team will be assembled they would need a time to meet, because everyone is busy in their own way we could do a tinder for time. So everyone will get a particular time and they can swipe left/right to accept or decline it. The time will be like 9:00 9:30 10:00 and etc 
	- If the type of adventure is random we could show him a wheel of fortune where there will be all the adventure types and the random one will win.


MPV: 
	For MVP would be good to have an adventure generation without any proofs, social networking etc. So just a map, adventure generation and a timer.
